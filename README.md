# Apache OpenServerless Streamer (incubating)

The OpenServerless streamer is a tool to relay a stream from OpenWhisk actions 
to an outside HTTP client.

The streamer is a simple HTTP server that exposes an endpoint 
/stream/{namespace}/{action} to invoke the relative OpenWhisk action, open a 
socket for the action to write to, and relay the output to the client.

It expects 2 environment variables to be set:
- `OW_APIHOST`: the OpenWhisk API host
- `STREAMER_ADDR`: the address of the streamer server for the OpenWhisk actions to connect to

Other environment variables can be set to configure the streamer:

- `HTTP_SERVER_PORT`: the port the streamer server listens on (default: 80)
  
Cors handling is handled through these variables:

- `CORS_ENABLED`: set to 1 or true to enable the CORS handler
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN`: this defaults to `*`
- `CORS_ALLOW_METHODS`: this defaults to `GET,POST,OPTIONS`
- `CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS`: this defaults to `Authorization,Content-Type`


## Endpoints

The streamer exposes the following endpoints (use POST in case you need to send 
arguments to the action):

- `GET/POST /action/{namespace}/{action}`: to invoke the OpenWhisk action on the 
given namespace, default package, and action name. It requires an Authorization
header with Bearer token with the OpenWhisk AUTH token.

- `GET/POST /action/{namespace}/{package}/{action}`: to invoke the OpenWhisk 
action on the given namespace, custom package, and action name. It requires an 
Authorization header with Bearer token with the OpenWhisk AUTH token

- `GET/POST /web/{namespace}/{action}`: to invoke an OpenWhisk web action on the 
given namespace, default package, and action name.

- `GET/POST /web/{namespace}/{package}/{action}`: to invoke an OpenWhisk web 
action on the given namespace, custom package, and action name.
